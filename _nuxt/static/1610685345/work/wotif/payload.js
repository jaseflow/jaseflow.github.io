It was the third consumer travel brand\nExpedia had acquired, with two more to follow shortly after.","Each brand brought on to the Expedia platform would have its\nexisting website replaced with a templatised version of Expedia.com. This made\nmaintaining code bases a breeze as well as rolling out any new features.","The only down side to this approach was that Google started penalising the\ngroup's landing pages for having duplicate content. This meant that if two or\nmore brands were competing against each other in the same region, only one of\nthem would get a spot in Google and they others were discarded. The original\nintention was that Expedia's brands would take up positions one, two and three when\nsomeone searched for a travel product.","#crawling-our-way-back-into-google","The team ran a bunch of tests to measure the traffic to each landing\npage when we made various changes. These changes included changing titles and\nlabels, reorganizing the content heirarchy, recompiling Javascript to use\ndifferent variable names and made sure the use of expedia.com was not used\nin any scripts. The most succesful tests were the ones where multiple changes\nwere made to the content, including the UI.","The ideal way to resolve these duplication issues would be for each brand to\ncome up with their own unique brand guidelines but this would most likely take\nup to a year to complete and the discarded brands were losing a lot of money\nevery day by getting access to the traffic from Google. So instead we chose to stay\naway from any brand level changes and instead created five unique content themes\nand assigned each brand a theme. These themes would dictate what kind of\ncontent we would prioritise, which in turn would guide our designs.","#theme-list","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","table","thead","ul",{},"Name","expedia","Content focus","tbody",{},"Direct","Existing theme untouched to use as a control","Reviewer","User generated content such as reviews and ratings","Lens","High quality destination and hotel images","Locale","Heavy use of maps and focus content on hotel location","Select","Increase amount of hotels displayed.

This meant that once the user clicked a link there was\non obvious disconnect.","It became clear that the right way to do this would be to break free from the\none size fits all approach and start the differentiation from the home page all\nthe way through to check out. This would naturally resolve the duplication\npenalties in Google and also create a stronger connection between the shopping\nexperience and the marketing material shown on television.","Below is a demonstration of a protoype I built that uses real data to deliver an\nexperience that is localised to Australian travellers and recnogizable for\nanyone who has been exposed to Wotif advertisements.","figure","\u002Ffinx\u002Ffinx-logo.svg","\u002Ftripjunkie\u002Ftripjunkie-mobile.jpg","div","video__content","\u002Ftripjunkie\u002Ftripjunkie-desktop.jpg","\u002Fwotif\u002Fscreenshot.jpg","\n      ","source","https:\u002F\u002Fjaseflow.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com\u002FWotif+-+Prototype.mp4","video\u002Fmp4","\u002Fwork\u002Fwotif")));
